# Intelligent-Debugging-Evaluator
Goal of this project is to create an online evaluator tool that is capable of evaluating the marks secured from the debugging test and display the result in the web browser itself. This system also has higher end features which will increase the effectiveness of the test module and then increase the efficiency of the programmers.

In real time system, these website are capable of only executing a string comparator mechanism. This Mechanism is not effective when the system results of the debugging are considered. These online compliers are only compilers system, not online evaluating system. 

This design algorithm segregates the available programs in database to easy, hard and medium based on number of errors, number of characters, number of loops, number of functions, number of variables and number of statements used. This algorithm module helps to improve programming level of learner. The adaptive function will test the user based on their performance and helps the user to improve their programming skills in that particular programming language.
